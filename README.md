### Study Overview
This study contains a data analysis of two datasets `Beers.csv`
and `Breweries.csv`. The goal is to derive insights from 2,410 craft beers
from 558 breweries in the United States. In an effort to further understand
two datasets that were studied this codebook was designed to allow the reader
to see how the data is comprised.

### The Data

`data/Beers.csv`


| FEATURE   | DESCRIPTION            |
|:---------:|:---------------------:|
|Name       | The name of the beer |
|BeerID     | The unique id number of the beer|
|ABV        | Alcohol by volume of the beer   |
|IBU        | The international bitterness of the units of the beer|
|Style      | The style of the beer |
|Ounces     | Unit of measurement for the beer denoted by oz.|



`data/Breweries.csv`


|FEATURE   | DESCRIPTION   |
|:--------:|:-------------:|
| Brew_ID | The unique identification number of the brewery|
| Name    | The name of the brewery |
| City    | The city where the brewery is located|
| State   |  The State where the brewery is located ```(Limited to the U.S.)``` |

### The Questions We're Interested in Answering

1.) How many breweries are currently present in each state? (US Specifically)

2.) Looking at both datasets together what are the first six observations and the
last six observations in the merged dataset?

3.) What is the number of missing data points in each column?

4.) What is the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state,
and what does the plot look like?

5.) Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter
(IBU) beer?

6.) What are the Summary statistics for the ABV variable?

7.) Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic
content?
